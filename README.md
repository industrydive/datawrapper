# Datawrapper

Datawrapper is a tool that enables anyone to create enticing visualizations in seconds, without any programming skills. This is Industry Dive's fork which is based on the Washington Post's fork of roughly version 1.7.9.

##Docker Install
Adjust your config.yaml and then:
```
cd /path/to/datwrapper
docker build --tag="industrydive/datawrap" . 
docker run -P --name datawrap -v `pwd`:/srv/datawrapper -i -t -p 80:80 industrydive/datawrap
```

##Installation instructions:

[Here are the published instructions](https://github.com/datawrapper/datawrapper/wiki/Installing-Datawrapper) which have a few errors/omissions (pull request is pending merge w/ origin) so below are our instructions, geared towards using MAMP for php/apache/mySQL (but anything will do).

- Install [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/)
- In `/Applications/MAMP/htdocs` clone this repo
- In MAMP preferences, point Apache to `datawrapper/www`
- In MAMP preferences, make sure you're using PHP > 5.2 (5.5.X is stable)
- Create the configuration file by copying config.yaml.template to config.yaml, edit the file, and change domain and chart_domain and the email addresses, as well as s3 configuration and, if using, ldap settings.
- Create a new MySQL database called datawrapper. Then, initialize the table schema using `/lib/core/build/sql/schema.sql`. In MAMP, this is straightforward through the phpMyAdmin SQL backend.
- Copy `lib/core/build/conf/datawrapper-conf.php.master` to `lib/core/build/conf/datawrapper-conf.php` and update your database settings (dbname, user, password) according to your server configuration.
- Install plugins through `php scripts/plugin.php install pluginname`. The plugins you need are:
	- admin*
	- core*
	- publish-s3
	- theme-wapo
	- visualization*
- Run ./dw.js/make
- Locally with MAMP, navigate to http://localhost:8888/ and get charting!


## Known bugs

- Some versions of Firefox: Clicking on chart create button redirects to homepage. #6
- Some versions of Firefox (noticed on v. 30): Upload data button gives alert "Error:
  false" and does not upload the data. #7
- In some cases, logging in from / which redirects to /login results in a redirect loop error. #5

It draws inspiration from [ManyEyes](http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/) and [GoogleCharts](https://developers.google.com/chart/) but remains entirely open-source and independent from a third-party server.

It was created by [Mirko Lorenz](http://www.mirkolorenz.com/), [Nicolas Kayser-Bril](http://nkb.fr) and [Gregor Aisch](http://driven-by-data.net/) and was funded by [ABZV](http://www.abzv.de/).
